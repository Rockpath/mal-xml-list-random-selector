# myanimelist-xml-parsing-app
The goal is to make a tool that provides the features that a user would like to have that the myanimelist website does not offer. Currently making use of the the exported xml lists you can get through one's myanimelist account. Current features: randomly selecting an anime/manga from one of the user's lists based on the status they have set for it.

In the future, I would like to expand this app beyond simply using the xml lists provided by myanimelist.net, but for now I am just setting up the base and experimenting. Definitely could use some optimization and whatnot, but that is not a high priority for me compared to functionality.

What will be added next: ability to make changes to the xml lists along with working on using tkinter to make a window ui to work with instead of solely the terminal. Also some basic cleanup and commenting.
