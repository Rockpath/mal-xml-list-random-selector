# myanimelist-xml-parsing-app
The goal is to make a tool that provides the features that a user would like to have that the myanimelist website does not offer. Currently making use of the the exported xml lists you can get through one's myanimelist account. Current features: randomly selecting an anime/manga from one of the user's lists based on the status they have set for it.
